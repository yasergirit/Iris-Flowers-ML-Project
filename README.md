# Iris-Flowers-ML-Project

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

It includes three iris species with 150 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other. The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the three species â€” virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.

The columns in this dataset are:

- Id
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species

# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes heavy use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Joblib and Data Visualization Libraries.
